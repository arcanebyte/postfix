# sys		This is the file where you define all the remote
#		UUCP systems you know about, whether you dial in to them
#		or they dial in to you.
#
#		Note that if you want to dial into another system, you
#		have to enter the loginname and password NOT here but
#		in the file /etc/uucp/call.

# First some defaults. These are for all other entries (unless overridden).

# Here's another alternate - we poll the system over TCP/IP. This is
# useful if we have a PPP connection to our provider. The first two entries
# will fail because the modem is busy and we will poll over TCP/IP.
